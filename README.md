## mest-int-py

Contains some short Python scripts for really basic algorithms used in introductory courses to AI in PTI.
These codes are meant to solve "pen-and-paper" exercises not real problems.

The real goal of these codes are to connect the "pen-and-paper" exercises with code.
Aka, in "pen-and-paper" problems they usually don't use operators and states,
but instead they give you graphs to lessen the cognitive load.
These codes are used by me to double check my own hand calculations.
